# StudentKitchen

This is our humble approach in implementing a Kotlin/SpringBoot-Application.
It was an assignment in our studys.

In StudentKitchen you can create and manage recipes.
First you need to register a account.
After that you can create a recipe or look at other recipes.
You can categorize the recipes and filter everything or add some favourites.
Also you have the possibility to edit your userprofile.

## To run this project you need to:
1. Install Database -> MariaDb or MySql
2. Change in application.properties the entrie for username and password to your credentials.
3. Change in application.properties entrie ddl-auto to create (Only for first time, after that again back to update)
4. Start the StudentenKuecheApplication.kt and enjoy :)
